  Implementation of Level Three Autonomous Driving on Electric Vehicle
  \hspace*{\fill}
  \dateformat Jul 2023 - Aug 2024
}
\begin{tasks}
  \task \textbf{Developed a Modular Autonomous System} for an electric vehicle, achieving level three autonomous capabilities using ROS (Robot Operating System) on Ubuntu 20
  \task \textbf{Implemented Navigation Stack:} Integrated ZED2 stereo camera for 3D object detection, outdoor mapping, and positional tracking; utilized GNSS for long-distance localization
  % \task \textbf{Trained AI Models} from Roboflow on Kaggle platform to enhance object detection capabilities
  % \task \textbf{Integrated Ultrasonic Sensors} to detect nearby objects and cover areas outside the camera's field of view, serving as a fallback for the AI system in the ROS layer
  \task \textbf{Monitoring Dashboard:} Developed using HTML, JS, and CSS to track vehicle state (position, driving mode) and view camera feeds. User can also send navigation goals directly to the vehicle
  \task \textbf{Vehicle Control:} Added steering control using a closed-loop stepper motor and managed actuator operations via microcontrollers, with communication between two MCUs through CAN bus
  \task \textbf{Obstacle Handling:} A multi-layer safety mechanism where the AI handles primary object detection, and the embedded layer, with ultrasonic sensors, ensures detection in cases where the AI fails
  \task \textbf{Achieved Recognition:}\\

  EVER V - Autonomous Track
  \hspace*{\fill}
  \dateformat Mar 2024 - Aug 2024
}
\begin{tasks}
  \task \textbf{Simulation Environment:} Developed and simulated autonomous driving scenarios in CoppeliaSim, ranging from simple single-lane tracks to complex environments with cones and pedestrian crossings
  \task \textbf{ROS Integration:} Controlled vehicle kinematics via ROS topics for steering, throttle, and braking; processed sensor data from a mono camera and Velodyne LIDAR
  \task \textbf{Control Systems:} Employed Simulink MATLAB blocks with Stanley Controller for lateral and longitudinal vehicle control in a closed-loop system.
