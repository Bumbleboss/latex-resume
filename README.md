# About
The entire list of my resumes made in LaTeX! They are separated by specialization, each with their own layout for good content flow. The plan is to automatically generate a PDF file from a layout template when specific data changes.

# Structure
The current structure separates each specialization to their individual branches, they are all similar in look but with changes tailored to personal requirements.

# Feedback
Feel free to add or detail a usecase in the repo.
